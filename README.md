# Data loader demo

Using any arbitrary data loading function that returns a promise, and a separate rendering component,
the idea here is to combine a simple wrapper around a component that requires some data to make the
code cleaner and easier to read.

## Setup

* `pnpm install` (or any package manager)
* `pnpm run dev`
* Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
* Read the code
